## **1. [On Countability and Separability of Metrizable Spaces](Expository-Articles/On_Countability_and_Separability_of_Metrizable_Spaces.pdf)**
*June 2025, [General Topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_topology)*

This expository article discusses foundational topological properties of metrizable spaces related to bases countability and separability, which are some classical results in general and metric topology. While assuming the reader's familiarity with basic topological concepts, the article briefly reviews foundational notions relevant to the proof, including topological bases, countability of bases, and separability. The proof is reconstructed with close attention to definitions and logical structure, aiming to serve as a learning document for students and enthusiasts of topology. No new results are claimed; the goal is to clarify a well-known implication in metric topology through self-guided exploration and careful exposition.
